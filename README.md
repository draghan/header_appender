## What's this project?

This is trivial project for appending header to specific files from given directory.

## How does it work?

Function 'get_files_from_directory' selects all files with particular extensions from given directory, excluded files from directories on blacklist. Then all found files are rewritten with defined header. All parameters are defined explicit in source code, there is no parsing of program's arguments implemented.
